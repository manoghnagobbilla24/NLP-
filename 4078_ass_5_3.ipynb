Notwithstanding the successes and\\nfuture potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of\\nthe potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are\\nperceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust\\nin critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are\\ncurrently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI\\ndevelopments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption.\\nTo bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding\\nprinciples drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best\\npractices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These\\nguiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)\\nFairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness\\nand (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are\\nfurther translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying,\\ndeveloping, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically\\ntrustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice.\",\n          \"To ensure safety in automated driving, the correct perception of the\\nsituation inside the car is as important as its environment. Thus, seat\\noccupancy detection and classification of detected instances play an important\\nrole in interior sensing. By the knowledge of the seat occupancy status, it is\\npossible to, e.g., automate the airbag deployment control. Furthermore, the\\npresence of a driver, which is necessary for partially automated driving cars\\nat the automation levels two to four can be verified. In this work, we compare\\ndifferent statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approach\\nthe problem of background-foreground segmentation in camera based interior\\nsensing. In the recent years, several methods based on different techniques\\nhave been developed and applied to images or videos from different\\napplications. The peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing is,\\nthat the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well as\\ndynamic elements. In data considered in this work, even the camera position is\\nnot completely fixed. We review and benchmark three different methods ranging,\\ni.e., Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Morphological Snakes and a deep neural\\nnetwork, namely a Mask R-CNN.

Despite these concerns and risks, there are\\ncurrently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI\\ndevelopments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption.\\nTo bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding\\nprinciples drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best\\npractices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These\\nguiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)\\nFairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness\\nand (vi) Explainability.

Thus, seat\\noccupancy detection and classification of detected instances play an important\\nrole in interior sensing. By the knowledge of the seat occupancy status, it is\\npossible to, e.g., automate the airbag deployment control. Furthermore, the\\npresence of a driver, which is necessary for partially automated driving cars\\nat the automation levels two to four can be verified. In this work, we compare\\ndifferent statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approach\\nthe problem of background-foreground segmentation in camera based interior\\nsensing. In the recent years, several methods based on different techniques\\nhave been developed and applied to images or videos from different\\napplications. The peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing is,\\nthat the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well as\\ndynamic elements. In data considered in this work, even the camera position is\\nnot completely fixed. We review and benchmark three different methods ranging,\\ni.e., Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Morphological Snakes and a deep neural\\nnetwork, namely a Mask R-CNN. In particular, the limitations of the classical\\nmethods, GMM and Morphological Snakes, for interior sensing are shown.\\nFurthermore, it turns, that it is possible to overcome these limitations by\\ndeep learning, e.g.\\\\ using a Mask R-CNN.

Notwithstanding the successes and\\nfuture potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of\\nthe potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are\\nperceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust\\nin critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are\\ncurrently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI\\ndevelopments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption.\\nTo bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding\\nprinciples drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best\\npractices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These\\nguiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)\\nFairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness\\nand (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are\\nfurther translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying,\\ndeveloping, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically\\ntrustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice.\",\n          \"To ensure safety in automated driving, the correct perception of the\\nsituation inside the car is as important as its environment. Thus, seat\\noccupancy detection and classification of detected instances play an important\\nrole in interior sensing. By the knowledge of the seat occupancy status, it is\\npossible to, e.g., automate the airbag deployment control. Furthermore, the\\npresence of a driver, which is necessary for partially automated driving cars\\nat the automation levels two to four can be verified. In this work, we compare\\ndifferent statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approach\\nthe problem of background-foreground segmentation in camera based interior\\nsensing. In the recent years, several methods based on different techniques\\nhave been developed and applied to images or videos from different\\napplications. The peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing is,\\nthat the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well as\\ndynamic elements. In data considered in this work, even the camera position is\\nnot completely fixed. We review and benchmark three different methods ranging,\\ni.e., Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Morphological Snakes and a deep neural\\nnetwork, namely a Mask R-CNN. In particular, the limitations of the classical\\nmethods, GMM and Morphological Snakes, for interior sensing are shown.\\nFurthermore, it turns, that it is possible to overcome these limitations by\\ndeep learning, e.g.\\\\ using a Mask R-CNN. Although only a small amount of ground\\ntruth data was available for training, we enabled the Mask R-CNN to produce\\nhigh quality background-foreground masks via transfer learning. Moreover, we\\ndemonstrate that certain augmentation as well as pre- and post-processing\\nmethods further enhance the performance of the investigated methods.\",\n          \"In this paper, we proposed a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) to\\neffectively exploit the unlabeled hard regions for semi-supervised medical\\nimage segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep\\nmodels trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain\\nand easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g. adhesive\\nedges or thin branches) for the image segmentation task. Leveraging these\\nregion-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation\\nmodel training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists\\nof two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple\\nsightly different decoders (i.e. using different up-sampling strategies). The\\nstatistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the\\nmodel's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, a new\\nmutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoder's probability\\noutput and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the\\nmodel's uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariant\\nand low-entropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data, in order\\nto learn a generalized feature representation. We compared the segmentation\\nresults of the MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on\\nthree public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two common\\nsemi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over\\nother existing methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised\\nmedical image segmentation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_summaries\",\n

Notwithstanding the successes and\\nfuture potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of\\nthe potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are\\nperceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust\\nin critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are\\ncurrently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI\\ndevelopments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption.\\nTo bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding\\nprinciples drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best\\npractices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These\\nguiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)\\nFairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness\\nand (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are\\nfurther translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying,\\ndeveloping, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically\\ntrustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice.\",\n          \"To ensure safety in automated driving, the correct perception of the\\nsituation inside the car is as important as its environment. Thus, seat\\noccupancy detection and classification of detected instances play an important\\nrole in interior sensing. By the knowledge of the seat occupancy status, it is\\npossible to, e.g., automate the airbag deployment control. Furthermore, the\\npresence of a driver, which is necessary for partially automated driving cars\\nat the automation levels two to four can be verified. In this work, we compare\\ndifferent statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approach\\nthe problem of background-foreground segmentation in camera based interior\\nsensing. In the recent years, several methods based on different techniques\\nhave been developed and applied to images or videos from different\\napplications. The peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing is,\\nthat the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well as\\ndynamic elements. In data considered in this work, even the camera position is\\nnot completely fixed. We review and benchmark three different methods ranging,\\ni.e., Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Morphological Snakes and a deep neural\\nnetwork, namely a Mask R-CNN. In particular, the limitations of the classical\\nmethods, GMM and Morphological Snakes, for interior sensing are shown.\\nFurthermore, it turns, that it is possible to overcome these limitations by\\ndeep learning, e.g.\\\\ using a Mask R-CNN. Although only a small amount of ground\\ntruth data was available for training, we enabled the Mask R-CNN to produce\\nhigh quality background-foreground masks via transfer learning. Moreover, we\\ndemonstrate that certain augmentation as well as pre- and post-processing\\nmethods further enhance the performance of the investigated methods.\",\n          \"In this paper, we proposed a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) to\\neffectively exploit the unlabeled hard regions for semi-supervised medical\\nimage segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep\\nmodels trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain\\nand easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g. adhesive\\nedges or thin branches) for the image segmentation task. Leveraging these\\nregion-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation\\nmodel training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists\\nof two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple\\nsightly different decoders (i.e. using different up-sampling strategies). The\\nstatistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the\\nmodel's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, a new\\nmutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoder's probability\\noutput and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the\\nmodel's uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariant\\nand low-entropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data, in order\\nto learn a generalized feature representation. We compared the segmentation\\nresults of the MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on\\nthree public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two common\\nsemi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over\\nother existing methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised\\nmedical image segmentation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"terms\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']\",\n          \"['cs.CV']\",\n          \"['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Notwithstanding the successes and\\nfuture potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of\\nthe potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are\\nperceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust\\nin critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are\\ncurrently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI\\ndevelopments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption.\\nTo bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding\\nprinciples drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best\\npractices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These\\nguiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)\\nFairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness\\nand (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are\\nfurther translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying,\\ndeveloping, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically\\ntrustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice.\",\n          \"To ensure safety in automated driving, the correct perception of the\\nsituation inside the car is as important as its environment. Thus, seat\\noccupancy detection and classification of detected instances play an important\\nrole in interior sensing. By the knowledge of the seat occupancy status, it is\\npossible to, e.g., automate the airbag deployment control. Furthermore, the\\npresence of a driver, which is necessary for partially automated driving cars\\nat the automation levels two to four can be verified. In this work, we compare\\ndifferent statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approach\\nthe problem of background-foreground segmentation in camera based interior\\nsensing. In the recent years, several methods based on different techniques\\nhave been developed and applied to images or videos from different\\napplications. The peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing is,\\nthat the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well as\\ndynamic elements. In data considered in this work, even the camera position is\\nnot completely fixed. We review and benchmark three different methods ranging,\\ni.e., Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Morphological Snakes and a deep neural\\nnetwork, namely a Mask R-CNN. In particular, the limitations of the classical\\nmethods, GMM and Morphological Snakes, for interior sensing are shown.\\nFurthermore, it turns, that it is possible to overcome these limitations by\\ndeep learning, e.g.\\\\ using a Mask R-CNN. Although only a small amount of ground\\ntruth data was available for training, we enabled the Mask R-CNN to produce\\nhigh quality background-foreground masks via transfer learning. Moreover, we\\ndemonstrate that certain augmentation as well as pre- and post-processing\\nmethods further enhance the performance of the investigated methods.\",\n          \"In this paper, we proposed a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) to\\neffectively exploit the unlabeled hard regions for semi-supervised medical\\nimage segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep\\nmodels trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain\\nand easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g. adhesive\\nedges or thin branches) for the image segmentation task. Leveraging these\\nregion-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation\\nmodel training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists\\nof two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple\\nsightly different decoders (i.e. using different up-sampling strategies). The\\nstatistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the\\nmodel's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, a new\\nmutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoder's probability\\noutput and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the\\nmodel's uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariant\\nand low-entropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data, in order\\nto learn a generalized feature representation. We compared the segmentation\\nresults of the MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on\\nthree public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two common\\nsemi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over\\nother existing methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised\\nmedical image segmentation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_summaries_spacy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"recent advancement artificial intelligence ai combine extensive datum generate today clinical system lead development imaging ai solution value chain medical imaging include image reconstruction medical image segmentation imagebase diagnosis treatment planning notwithstanding success future potential ai medical imaging stakeholder concerned potential risk ethical implication imaging ai solution perceive complex opaque difficult comprehend utilise trust critical clinical application despite concern risk currently concrete guideline good practice guide future ai development medical imaging increase trust safety adoption bridge gap paper introduce careful selection guide principle draw accumulate experience consensus good practice large european project ai health imaging guide principle name futureai building block consist fairness ii universality iii traceability iv usability v robustness vi explainability stepbystep approach guideline translate framework concrete recommendation specify develop evaluating deploy technically clinically ethically trustworthy ai solution clinical practice\",\n          \"ensure safety automated drive correct perception situation inside car important environment seat occupancy detection classification detect instance play important role interior sensing knowledge seat occupancy status possible eg automate airbag deployment control furthermore presence driver necessary partially automate driving car automation level verify work compare different statistical method field image segmentation approach problem backgroundforeground segmentation camera base interior sense recent year method base different technique develop apply image video different application peculiarity give scenario interior sensing foreground instance background contain static dynamic element datum consider work camera position completely fix review benchmark different method range ie gaussian mixture model gmm morphological snake deep neural network mask rcnn particular limitation classical method gmm morphological snake interior sensing show furthermore turn possible overcome limitation deep learning eg mask rcnn small ground truth datum available training enable mask rcnn produce high quality backgroundforeground mask transfer learning demonstrate certain augmentation pre postprocesse method enhance performance investigate method\",\n          \"paper propose novel mutual consistency network mcnet effectively exploit unlabeled hard region semisupervise medical image segmentation mcnet model motivate observation deep model train limited annotation prone output highly uncertain easily misclassifie prediction ambiguous region eg adhesive edge thin branch image segmentation task leverage regionlevel challenging sample semisupervised segmentation model training effective propose mcnet model consist new design model contain shared encoder multiple sightly different decoder ie different upsampling strategy statistical discrepancy multiple decoder output compute denote model uncertainty indicate unlabeled hard region second new mutual consistency constraint enforce decoder probability output decoder soft pseudo label way minimize model uncertainty training force model generate invariant lowentropy result challenging area unlabeled datum order learn generalized feature representation compare segmentation result mcnet stateoftheart semisupervise approach public medical dataset extension experiment common semisupervised setting demonstrate superior performance model exist method set new state art semisupervise medical image segmentation\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
